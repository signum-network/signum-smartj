/**
 * A Non-Fungible Token smart contract with sale and auction capabilities.
 * 
 * The contract has an owner that can transfer the ownership to another address.
 * Additionally, the owner can put the token up for sale or for auction with a
 * given timeout. The auction can have a max price set or it can also be a Dutch
 * stile auction.
 * 
 * All operations are handled directly by the contract, so it is completely
 * decentralized.
 *
 * At every sale, the original creator can receive royalties and
 * the platform can get a fee. The current royalties holder can also transfer
 * the rights to another address (or contract).
 * 
 * All fees are configurable at the creation of the contract.
